# TinyURL

This application is developed using react and node.js 

Clone the repo and use npm run dev to run the application 

Functionality: 
   The applicaton has both front end and back end. In the front end there is a textbox where you can enter the url you want to shorten. On submit you get the shortened url in the table below. Also can view the request details in the console logs of the application.
   
 Also, there is a click count maintained for the short urls. Whenever, user uses the shorturl the click count increases. 
 
 3 API's are being used. 
  1. To shorten the url (http://localhost:8080/) This is a post request
  2. To access the shortened url (http://localhost:8080/:url) This is get
  3. To display all the urls that are shortened (http://localhost:8080/api/allurls) This is get
  
 The short id code is generated by using the shortid library of node.
 
 Future additions that can be done: 
   1. Add the time when the url was created. Based on this we can make the url inaccessible after a period of time 
   2. Now, a user is able to see all the urls shortened by anybody, in future may be create sessions so that user see only the users shortened by him and not   anyone else
